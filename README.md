Implementation of graph and tree search algorithms for solving two problems, Artificial Intelligence course assignment, Fall 2018
## Problem #1
The graph of the map of Romania is as follows: <br/>

Imagine we want to travel from Arad city to Bucharest.<br>
The list in the right side of the graph indicates the hurestic values for different cities, direct distances from Bucharest city. <br/>
This problem should be solved with the use of Depth-first search,Breadth-first search, Uniform-Cost Search, Greedy best-first search and A^* algorithms.<br/>
## Problem #2
The nodes of the following graph should be painted with 3 colors in a way that neighbor nodes do not have the same color as long as possible. Evaluation function should be defined according to this. <br/>
This problem should be solved using
